# Grayscale filters

This is one of the projects I worked on during an internship, applying the knowledge gained from
my mentors. The project uses the C++ programming language, the OpenCV library for image
processing, QtCreator, QtDesigner and CSS for the interface.
The user uploads an image from their personal computer with the aim of transforming it into a
black and white image, using one of the implemented grayscale algorithms. The application, testing,
and a local pipeline are generated using CMake, CTest, CDash. The documentation is generated
using Doxygen.
